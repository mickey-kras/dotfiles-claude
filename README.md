# dotfiles
AI toolchain config synced across machines with [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io). One command sets up Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex with shared MCPs, profile-aware permissions, capability packs, and Bitwarden-backed secret wrappers.

## Quick start

**macOS / Linux / WSL / Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickey-kras/dotfiles/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh)
```

**Already have chezmoi?**
```bash
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:mickey-kras/dotfiles.git
```

**Can't use SSH?** The repo is public - HTTPS works without auth:
```bash
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/mickey-kras/dotfiles.git
```

**No git/SSH access at all?** Download the [zip from GitHub](https://github.com/mickey-kras/dotfiles/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract to `~/dotfiles`, then:
```bash
chezmoi init --apply --source ~/dotfiles
```

The installer now asks for:
1. **Runtime profile** - `restricted`, `balanced`, `open`, or `custom`
2. **Capability pack** - currently `software-development`
3. **Display name, role summary, stack summary**
4. **Azure DevOps org** - optional
5. **Custom MCPs and permission groups** if `custom` is selected

If `gum` is installed, setup uses a richer TUI. Otherwise it falls back to plain Bash prompts.

## What gets installed

### Runtime profiles

`restricted`
- remote work systems allowed
- no local or system mutation by default
- no `uv` or `uvx`
- no high-injection web MCPs

`balanced`
- `restricted` plus practical local execution and containers
- good default for work machines

`open`
- `balanced` plus cloud, web, and high-injection MCPs
- best fit for trusted personal machines

`custom`
- curated MCP catalog and permission groups
- you choose the exact subset

### Capability packs

Current pack:
- `software-development`

This pack provides the SDLC team model across tools:
- Claude Code subagents
- Codex operating model
- Cursor rules and workflow guidance
- Managed first-party workflow skills for Claude and Codex

Future packs can reuse the same runtime profiles while swapping the working style and capability surface.

### MCPs

All versions are pinned for supply-chain safety. OAuth MCPs authenticate in the browser on first use.

| Server | Profiles | Transport | Auth | Risk | What it does |
|--------|----------|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Playwright 0.0.68 | restricted, balanced, open | stdio (npx) | None | medium | Browser automation and E2E testing |
| Context7 | restricted, balanced, open | Remote HTTP | OAuth | low | Up-to-date library docs and code examples |
| Figma | restricted, balanced, open | Remote HTTP | OAuth | medium | Design-to-code: layouts, tokens, component variants |

| Firecrawl 3.11.0 | open | stdio (npx) | API key | high | Web scraping and crawling |
| fal-ai 2.1.4 | open | stdio (npx) | API key | medium | AI image generation |

**Bitwarden-backed MCPs** require [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/) plus a valid `~/.bw_session` file. Run `bw-login` after installing dotfiles to refresh the shared session cache used by Claude, Codex, and Cursor.

Required Bitwarden items and structure:
- `mcp-github`: login password = GitHub PAT
- `mcp-aws`: custom fields `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `mcp-tailscale`: login password = Tailscale API key, custom field `TAILSCALE_TAILNET`
- `exa-api-key`: login password = Exa API key
- `firecrawl-api-key`: login password = Firecrawl API key
- `fal-api-key`: login password = fal.ai API key

Then:
```bash
bw-login
export BW_SESSION="$(cat ~/.bw_session)"
chezmoi apply
```

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| delivery-orchestrator | Front door for free-form requests; decomposes work and routes to the right specialists |
| planner | Builds phased implementation plans with file targets, risks, and verification |
| product-manager | Clarifies problem, scope, tradeoffs, and success criteria |

| incident-commander | Coordinates production incident response, containment, and rollback direction |

### Skills

The `software-development` pack also installs first-party workflow skills into:
- `~/.claude/skills`
- `~/.codex/skills`

Currently managed:
- `context7-mcp`
- `context-budget`
- `dispatching-parallel-agents`
- `executing-plans`
- `obsidian-memory`
- `receiving-code-review`
- `requesting-code-review`
- `systematic-debugging`
- `test-driven-development`
- `using-git-worktrees`
- `verification-before-completion`
- `writing-plans`

These are installed from the first-party source in `packs/software-development/skills`, not from the live Claude plugin cache.

### Memory

The default memory provider remains the local `memory` MCP.

Optional explicit memory path:
- Obsidian via MCPVault (`@bitbonsai/mcpvault`)
- configured through the installer with a vault path
- stays local-first and replaces the generic `memory` server wiring when selected

### Intended `~/.claude` layout

The goal is to keep `~/.claude` small and honest: only live configuration and capability surfaces should remain there. Runtime residue like transcripts, caches, telemetry, paste history, shell snapshots, and temporary session state should be disposable.

Keep:
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `agents/`
- `hooks/`
- `plugins/`
- `rules/`
- `skills/`
- `settings.json`
- `settings.local.json`

Treat everything else as runtime state:
- safe to recreate
- safe to clear during cleanup
- not something to manage in dotfiles

### Permissions and settings

`~/.claude/settings.json` is now runtime-profile-aware:
- `restricted` keeps a read-heavy baseline and blocks `uv` and `uvx`
- `balanced` adds practical local execution and container workflows
- `open` adds broader package, cloud, secret, and web access

All profiles still keep:
- `model: "opus"`
- `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=false`
- dangerous operation denies like `sudo` and `rm -rf /`

`~/.claude/settings.local.json` is also managed and intentionally reset to a minimal empty override by default. That keeps profile compliance real by removing stale ad hoc local approvals unless you deliberately extend the model to support a small generated local exception set.

`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` contains lightweight global preferences (Conventional Commits, feature branches, CLI-first workflow), is rendered with your configured display name, explicitly requires MCP-only workflows with no connectors, and explicitly ignores Sentry even if it appears locally.

`~/.codex/AGENTS.md` mirrors those same global preferences for Codex, so both tools behave consistently across machines. Cursor gets the same MCP-only and ignore rules through `~/.cursor/rules/global.mdc`.

Global Git hooks are also installed at `~/.config/git/hooks` and enabled through `core.hooksPath`, so the same charset and no-AI-attribution rules are enforced before commit and before push across all local repositories.

`~/.local/bin/bw-mcp` and `~/.local/bin/bw-login` are installed as shared helpers so Claude, Codex, and Cursor can all use the same Bitwarden-backed MCP definitions. `bw-login` writes the unlocked session token to `~/.bw_session`; export it into the current shell only when a shell-driven command needs it immediately.

## What gets configured

| Tool | Config files |
|------|-------------|
| Claude Code CLI | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, `agents/`, `skills/` + MCPs reconciled via `claude mcp add/remove` |
| Claude Desktop | MCPs reconciled into `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, `~/.cursor/rules/global.mdc` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `~/.codex/skills/` |

## Updating

```bash
dotfiles-update   # Pull, apply, check versions, verify profile-aligned MCPs, security scan
```

Installed at `~/.local/bin/dotfiles-update` by chezmoi. Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

On Windows, Git Bash is the supported path. Small `.cmd` wrappers are installed alongside selected helpers for launcher compatibility, but setup and ongoing management are Bash-first. Git Bash (`bash` in PATH) is required and comes with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org).

For a quick pull-only update: `chezmoi update`

## Security

- **Pinned versions** - All stdio MCPs use exact version numbers to prevent supply-chain attacks via malicious updates.
- **No secrets in repo** - API keys are fetched from Bitwarden at `chezmoi apply` time.
- **OAuth MCPs** (Context7, Figma) authenticate via browser - no tokens stored locally.
- **Prompt-injection awareness** - `http`, `exa`, and `firecrawl` are intentionally `open`-only because they ingest broad remote content.
- **Authoritative reconciliation** - setup removes unmanaged or out-of-profile Claude MCPs by default to return the machine to the selected profile.
- **Periodic audit** - Run `npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-scan` to scan installed MCPs for tool poisoning.

## Dependencies

**Required:** git, chezmoi (auto-installed by bootstrap), bash (Git Bash on Windows)

**For MCPs:** node, npx

**For open-profile MCPs only:** `uv` and `uvx`

**For richer setup UI:** `gum`

**For Bitwarden-backed MCPs:** Bitwarden CLI (`bw`)
